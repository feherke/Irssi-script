6.5 %9Channel modes%9

Common channel modes are:

  %mi%N - Invite only - People can't join to channel without being /%wINVITE%Nd, or
    being in invite list (%m+I%N, see below).
  %mm%N - Moderated - People who don't have voices (%m+v%N) can't send messages to
    channel
  %mp%N - Private - People who aren't joined to channel can't see it for example
    with /%wWHOIS%Ning people who are in channel.
  %ms%N - Secret - Like private, but the channel isn't displayed in /%wLIST%N's output.
  %mn%N - No external msgs - Without this mode, anyone can send messages to channel
    without even being joined.
  %mt%N - Topic can be changed only by channel operators.

  %mk%N <key> - Channel password (aka. key) - The channel can't be joined without
    specifying the channel key (see section 6.2).

  %ml%N <count> - User limit - No more than <count> people can join to channel.
    This can be overridden with /%wINVITE%N with some servers.

    This is usually used for protecting channel from join flooding, like some
    bot allows max. 5 users to join in one minute or so.

  %mb%N - Set/remove ban. For example %wMODE%N #channel %m+b%N *!*@*.org bans everyone from
    .org domain.

    If someone from .org domain was already in channel before the ban was set,
    he/she cannot send any messages to channel (doesn't work with all servers).

    Bans can also be overridden with /%wINVITE%N, although many stupid IRC clients
    automatically kick the user out because they see the ban and think that
    because of it the user shouldn't be in the channel (doesn't work with all
    servers).

  %me%N - Ban exceptions. You could for example ban everyone from *!*@*.org but set
    ban exception to *!*@*.host.org - does not work with all servers.

  %mI%N - Invite list. If channel is invite only (%m+i%N), people in this list can join
    it without being /%wINVITE%Nd - does not work with all servers.

    This is excellent for in-country channels that don't want foreigners
    (spammers!) to join the channel, for example setting channel's mode to %m+i%N
    and %m+I%N *!*@*.fi allows only finnish people to join the channel. In addition
    to this, there's usually a bot in the channels and sending /%wMSG%N bot invite
    command to it /%wINVITE%Ns you to the channel.

    On IRCnet, the '%9:%9' feature in channel names can also be used for a similar
    effect, see section 6.2.

  %mo%N <nick> - Grant or revoke channel operator status from nick
  %mv%N <nick> - Grant or revoke voice status from nick, only people with %m+v%N (or
    %m+o%N) can talk to channel when it's moderated (%m+m%N).

You can send multiple mode changes with one mode command:

  /%wMODE%N #channel %m+nto-o+v%N nick1,nick2,nick3

This would set channel's mode to %m+nt%N, give ops to nick1, take ops from nick2
and give voices to nick3.

You can set only limited number of modes that requires argument in one command.
In IRCnet it's 3, in EFnet it's 4 and in many others it's 6. If it's not known,
Irssi defaults to 3. Irssi will also automatically split them, so you can use
/%wMODE%N %m+oooooo%N n1,n2,.. command to op 6 people and Irssi will split it to two
commands in IRCnet/EFnet.

Many networks have additional modes and/or change the meaning of existing
modes. Check the documentation for the network or the server software in use
for details.

Instead of manually setting %mo%N, %mv%N and %mb%N modes you probably want to use /%wOP%N,
/%wDEOP%N, /%wVOICE%N, /%wDEVOICE%N, /%wBAN%N and /%wUNBAN%N commands.

/%wOP%N, /%wDEOP%N, /%wVOICE%N and /%wDEVOICE%N commands allows wildcards as their argument. So
/%wOP%N ni* will op all non-opped people whose nick start with "ni". /%wDEOP%N * will
deop everyone else except you. /%wVOICE%N and /%wDEVOICE%N work the same way.

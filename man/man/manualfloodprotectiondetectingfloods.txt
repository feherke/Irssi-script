3.3 %9Detecting floods%9

Irssi is all the time automatically checking different flooding, when flood is
noticed, it sends "%9flood%9" signal. This can be easily used for example to create
a script for kicking channel flooders. Autoignore uses this also, see section
10.2.

Flood is detected when more than `%cflood_max_msgs%N' same kind of messages arrives
in `%cflood_timecheck%N' seconds to same target (channel or private msg) so it
isn't flooding if same user sends a message to 10 different channels you are
on, but it is flooding if 10 messages are sent to same channel by the same
user.

Currently only messages, notices and ctcps are checked for flooding.

  /%wSET%N %cflood_max_msgs%N = <count>, default is 4
  /%wSET%N %cflood_timecheck%N = <seconds>, default is 5 seconds

If either of these is 0, the flood checking is disabled.

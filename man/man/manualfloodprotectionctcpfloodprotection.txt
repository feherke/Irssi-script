3.2 %9CTCP flood protection%9

Other people can pretty easily flood you with CTCP requests, and even if you
wouldn't get kicked out from the server, they could easily grow your command
queue. So, Irssi's CTCP flood protection works like this:

First it checks how big the CTCP reply queue is, if it's longer than
`%cmax_ctcp_queue%N', the CTCP is ignored. You can change it with
/%wSET%N %cmax_ctcp_queue%N <count> (default is 5).

After this the CTCP reply is placed to server's "idle queue", so the reply is
sent "when there's extra time", this means that if you are busy sending other
commands, it might take a while before the reply is sent.

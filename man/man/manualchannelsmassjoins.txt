6.7 %9Massjoins%9

Automatic opping the nick right after joined to channel is a pretty commonly
used. What mostly irritates me with this is that the nick may be opped multiple
times by different people, or after netsplits when the people join back, the
server will op them, but still the bots op the people again, even if it was
just done by the server.

Irssi has this feature that it sends a "%9massjoin%9" signal a while after the real
join. If someone has already opped the nick, you can easily check it in the
massjoin signal handler.

The default is to report maximum of 5 joins in one massjoin signal. If the 5
joins don't come in 5 seconds, the signal is sent anyway. You can change these
with /%wSET%N %cmassjoin_max_wait%N <milliseconds> and /%wSET%N %cmassjoin_max_joins%N <count>.

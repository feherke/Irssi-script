9. %9Text highlighting%9

Irssi supports highlighting lines that match the specified pattern. You can
also change the color of the nicks that match specified nick mask, so you could
for example show your friends' nicks with different color.

  /%wHILIGHT%N [%9-mask%9 | %9-regexp%9 | %9-word%9] [%9-nick%9] [%9-color%9 <color>]
    [%9-level%9 <level>] [%9-channels%9 <channels>] <text>

    %9-mask%9: Match only for nick, <text> is a nick mask
    %9-regexp%9: <text> is a regular expression
    %9-word%9: <text> must match to full words
    %9-nick%9: Hilight only the nick, not the whole line
    %9-color%9: Print the reply with <color>. color is in %%code format (see
      docs/formats.txt)
    %9-level%9: Match only for <level> messages, default is %9publics%9,%9msgs%9,%9notices%9,
      %9actions%9
    %9-channels%9: Match only in <channels>

  /%wDEHILIGHT%N <ref#> | <text>

/%wHILIGHT%N without any arguments displays list of the hilights.

If <color> is a number, Irssi will treat it as a MIRC color code. You can also
use bolds (^B), underlines (^_) etc. as <color> if you like.

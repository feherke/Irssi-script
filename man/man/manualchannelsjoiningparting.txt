6.2 %9Joining, parting%9

Channels can be joined with /%wJOIN%N command. You can join to multiple channels
with one /%wJOIN%N by giving it a comma-separated list of channels, like
/%wJOIN%N #channel1,#channel2. If you don't give the channel mode character (%9#+&!%9)
before the channel name, Irssi automatically uses #channels.

Channel names may contain any characters except SPACE, BELL, NUL, CR, LF or
comma ('%9,%9'). On IRCnet and a few other networks, you can also restrict the
channel to only certain servers by adding the mask to the end of the channel
name separated with a '%9:%9' character, for example #channel:*.fi lets only people
on .fi servers join the channel. Other servers will not even know about the
channel. This is pretty difficult to use, since everyone will have to always
join #channel:*.fi; #channel and #channel:*.fi are different channels. Ban
exceptions (%m+e%N) and especially invite lists (%m+I%N) replace this functionality
pretty well, see section 6.5.

If channel has a password (aka. key), you can join it with /%wJOIN%N #channel pass,
or multiple channels with passwords with

  /%wJOIN%N #secret1,#public,#secret2 pass1,x,pass2

#public didn't have any password, so we used "x" as it's password. It doesn't
really matter what password you send with channels that don't have passwords.

If you want to join to channel in different server than active one in window,
you can do it with /%wJOIN%N -<server tag> #channel, like /%wJOIN%N -efnet #irssi.

You can leave channels with /%wPART%N [<channels>] [<part message>]. For example
"/%wPART%N byebye all" leaves the active channel with "byebye all" message, or
/%wPART%N #chan1,#chan2 leaves those channels.

NOTE: Sending %wJOIN%N 0 directly to server (/%Wquote%N join 0) leaves all the channels
you are joined. There's been some jokes about joining for example to #2000,0
where the server actually leaves you from all channels. With Irssi this isn't
really a problem, since irssi would happily join to channels #2000 and #0.

Irssi supports a number of reserved, dynamic variables, sometimes
referred to as expandos.  They are special in that the client is
constantly updating their values automatically.  There are also
numerous variable modifiers available.

%9Modifier%9          %9Description%9
%Y$variable%N         A normal variable, expanding to the first match of:
                  1) an internal %wSET%N variable
                  2) an environment variable
%Y$[num]variable%N    Expands to the variables value, with '%9num%9' width.  If
                  the number is negative, the value is right-aligned.
                  The value is padded to meet the width with the
                  character given after number (default is space).
                  The value is truncated to specified width unless
                  '%9!%9' character precedes the number. If '%9.%9' character
                  precedes the number the value isn't padded, just
                  truncated.
%Y$#variable%N        Expands to the number of words in $variable. If %9$variable%9
                  is omitted, it assumes %9$*%9
%Y$@variable%N        Expands to the number of characters in $variable. if
                  %9$variable%9 is omitted, it assumes %9$*%9
%Y$($subvariable)%N   This is somewhat similar to a pointer, in that the
                  value of %9$subvar%9 is taken as the name of the
                  variable to expand to.  Nesting is allowed.
%Y${expression}%N     Permits the value to be embedded in another string
                  unambiguously.
%Y$!history!%N        Expands to a matching entry in the client's command
                  history, wildcards allowed.

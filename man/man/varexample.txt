For example, assume you have the following alias:

   %Walias%N blah msg %9$D%9 Hi there!

If /blah is passed any arguments, they will automatically be appended to the
%wMSG%N text.  For example:

   /blah oops                          %y/* command as entered */%N
   "Hi there! oops"                    %y/* text sent to $D */%N

Another useful form is %9${}%9.  In general, variables can be embedded inside
strings without problems, assuming the surrounding text could not be
misinterpreted as part of the variable name.  This form guarantees that
surrounding text will not affect the expression's return value.

   /%Weval%N %Wecho%N foo$Nfoo                 %y/* breaks, looks for $nfoo */%N
   /%Weval%N %Wecho%N foo%9${N}%9foo               %y/* ${N} returns current nickname */%N
   fooYourNickfoo                      %y/* returned by above command */%N

6.4 %9After-join automation%9

When joined to channel, Irssi asks some information about it. After it has got
all of it, it prints the "Channel synchronized" text. The following information
is asked:

 - Channel mode
 - %wWHO%N list to get nicks' hosts - useful for /%wBAN%N for example
 - Ban list - useful for allowing /%wUNBAN%N to use wildcards

If you have joined many channels at once, Irssi tries to optimize the commands
it sends to server. Instead of sending two commands to ask two channels' mode,
it just sends %wMODE%N #a,#b. Same thing with %wWHO%N list and ban lists. Some
servers do not support this and they reply with different kinds of error
messages, Irssi tries to deal with them all right and resend the commands again
separately. However, some strange servers sometimes use some weird error
replies that Irssi doesn't know about, and the channel never gets synchronized.
If this happens with some server you know, please let the Irssi's author know
about it.

8. %9Notify list%9

Notify list is generally used for knowing when someone you know comes to IRC or
leaves from IRC. Traditionally notify list can handle only a list of nicks, no
nick masks etc. I lost interest to traditional notify lists long time ago,
since the people I know are in IRC all the time. So I made a bit more
featureful notify list:

  /%wNOTIFY%N [%9-list%9] [%9-away%9] [%9-idle%9 [minutes]] <mask> [network [network...]]

    %9-away%9: Notifies about away-status changes
    %9-idle%9: Notifies if idle time is first larger than <minutes> (default is
      hour) and then it drops down.
    %9-list%9: Lists the notify list entries with all their settings
    <mask>: Either a simple "nick" or "nick!*@*blah.org". The nick can't
      contain wildcards, but the user/host can.

  /%wUNNOTIFY%N <mask>

/%wNOTIFY%N without any arguments displays if the people in notify list are online
or offline.

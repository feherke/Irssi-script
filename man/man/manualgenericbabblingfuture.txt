0.3 %9Future%9

What about Irssi 1.0, what will it look like?

I was thinking about the Linux kernel versioning and keeping Irssi 0.8 a stable
version all the time while developing new features only to Irssi 0.9. After 0.9
is finished, it will be called 0.10 or 1.0 depending if I think it's ready to
be called 1.0.

1.0's goal is that it has all the possible features anyone will ever need. If
not build-in, then in scripts or loadable modules. Not very small goal :)

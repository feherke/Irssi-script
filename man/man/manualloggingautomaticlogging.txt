11.3 %9Automatic logging%9

This is the logging method that I had been asked to implement for ages, and it
is really simple to use too. It logs only messages that have "targets", ie.
private messages and channel specific messages (msgs, modes, topics, etc).
%wWHOIS%N replies and such aren't logged. If you with to log them too, use the /%wLOG%N
command.

So, when for example a private messages comes to you from "guy" nick, Irssi
creates a log file ~/irclogs/guy.log for it. After few minutes of inactivity,
the log file is closed.

/%wSET%N %cAUTOLOG%N %9ON%9|%9OFF%9|%9TOGGLE%9 - Enable/disable autolog.

/%wSET%N %cAUTOLOG_LEVEL%N <level> - Specifies what levels to log, default is ALL.

/%wSET%N %cAUTOLOG_PATH%N <path> - expandos (see special_vars.txt) can be used, %9$0%9 is
the target. If you are using multiple servers, it makes sense to use the server
tag as part of the file name, for example ~/irclogs/%9$tag%9/%9$0%9.log (this is the
default). The directories are created automatically.

4.1 %9Configuration files%9

The configuration is saved to ~/.irssi/config file. You can edit it with text
editor if you want, you can also add comments to it and they stay there even if
/%wSAVE%N is used. Comments are the lines starting with %9#%9 character. Any errors in
config file are displayed at startup.

Irssi uses it's own config library for handling the config file. The format is
pretty much the same as in libPropList and should be easily understandable.

You can reload the config file on the fly with /%wRELOAD%N command, you can also
read a different config file with /%wRELOAD%N <filename>.

If you change any settings, they aren't saved to file until you use /%wSAVE%N. You
can save the config file to different place with /%wSAVE%N <filename>.

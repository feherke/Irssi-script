3.1 %9Command flood protection%9

Most (all?) IRC servers' flood protection works like this (from RFC 1459):

--------
* check to see if client's `message timer' is less than current time (set to be
  equal if it is);

* read any data present from the client;

* while the timer is less than ten seconds ahead of the current time, parse any
  present messages and penalize the client by 2 seconds for each message;

which in essence means that the client may send 1 message every 2 seconds
without being adversely affected.
--------

Irssi's flood protection works the same way, except it penalizes 2.2 seconds by
default for each message (helps with some servers). You can change it with
/%wSET%N %ccmd_queue_speed%N <milliseconds>. You can also change the number of commands
before flood protection activates (ie. the burst count) with
/%wSET%N %ccmd_max_at_once%N <count>.

IRC servers also have an input buffer where the client's commands are saved
before processed. It's size is server specific (can be as low as 1k!) If it
gets full, the server kicks you out (the "Excess flood" quit message). Irssi's
flood protecion protects this pretty well with small commands, but if you send
many big commands (like >400 char long messages) fast, you could get easily
kicked out. Normally this isn't problem, but if you have scripts sending long
messages, you should remember this. I'm not sure how much you should wait
between the long messages, but 2 seconds isn't enough.

This protection is used with all commands sent to server, so you don't need to
worry about it with your scripts.
